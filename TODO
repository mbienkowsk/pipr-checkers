# STUFF TO DO

## TESTS

- testing eq of pieces messes up their hash, messing up the entire game
- if we got time:
    1. test player_possible_moves where a piece is blocked but exists
    2. tests for the piece and minimaxbot moving functions requiring a board import

## Come up with improvements to the evaluate_position function

- won endgames: if the bot has x pieces more than the opponent
and the opponent has less than y, change the strategy

## Implement the option to select a MINIMAX_DEPTH

- terminal?
- maybe stick with the time limit?

## all the fixmes

## usunac self.times z bota minimaxowego

## describe the methodology in the docs

## FOOKIN TYPE HINTS
