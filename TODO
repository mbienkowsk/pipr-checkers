# STUFF TO DO

## Check whether player_has_to_attack can be simplified during update_possible_moves_by_colors - it would save a ton of time

## Come up with improvements to the evaluate_position function

## Implement the option to select a MINIMAX_DEPTH

- terminal?
- maybe stick with the time limit?

## FOOKIN TYPE HINTS

## FLAKE

## MAX_MOVES_WITHOUT_ATTACKS AS A CONSTANT

## player color dictionary to be entirely an attribute of game and to be accessed by a getter and an index?

## MULTIPLE JUMPS POSSIBLE AT THE SAME TIME BUG
