# STUFF TO DO

## tests

- testing eq of pieces messes up their hash, messing up the entire game
- if we got time:
    1. test player_possible_moves where a piece is blocked but exists
    2. tests for the piece and minimaxbot moving functions requiring a board import

## Come up with improvements to the evaluate_position function

## Implement the option to select a MINIMAX_DEPTH

- terminal?
- maybe stick with the time limit?

## MULTIPLE JUMPS POSSIBLE AT THE SAME TIME BUG??

## all the fixmes

## usunac self.times z bota minimaxowego

## FLAKE

## FOOKIN TYPE HINTS

## move tests inside a designated folder
