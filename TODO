# STUFF TO DO

## tests

- testing eq of pieces messes up their hash, messing up the entire game
- if we got time:
    1. test player_possible_moves where a piece is blocked but exists
    2. tests for the piece and minimaxbot moving functions requiring a board import

## Check whether player_has_to_attack can be simplified during update_possible_moves_by_colors - it would save a ton of time

## Come up with improvements to the evaluate_position function

## Implement the option to select a MINIMAX_DEPTH

- terminal?
- maybe stick with the time limit?

## MAX_MOVES_WITHOUT_ATTACKS AS A CONSTANT

## MULTIPLE JUMPS POSSIBLE AT THE SAME TIME BUG??

## co z random botem? podzielic sensowniej klasy

## all the fixmes

## usunac self.times z bota minimaxowego

## GETTERS AND SETTERS FOR SELECTED PIECE

## merge player_has_to_attack into the attr dict without having to call the function which acts like a getter

## FLAKE

## FOOKIN TYPE HINTS
